In 2017, I joined Dynatrace, where until today, with a great team we achieve new business goals, providing users with the comfort of their work. I live in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. You can meet me on a walk or on a bicycle trip with my family. I am a huge advocate of the open source movement, so on my GitHub you will find a lot of stuff that I release under an open source license. Apart from usability design, my interests include data visualization and music creation. This is also reflected in my repositories.
